### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ My name is Ronak Shah and I am an aspiring Business Analyst professional and a recent graduate of UCLA. My experience so far has been within the supply chain analytics space due to my passion for improving business processes from a data-driven perspective. I am looking to upgrade on my skills everyday and this will be a log of some of my personal projects. I am experienced in Excel and PowerBI but am actively working on Python and SQL skills.
